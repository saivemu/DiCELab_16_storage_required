#Optimal storage sizing for grid level energy storage to tackle intermittent renewable energy sources 


This repository comprises of the code I wrote for my research project at Distributed Control of Energy Systems Lab, University of Florida, under the guidance of [Dr. Prabir Barooah](http://web.mae.ufl.edu/pbarooah/).


##Instructions

In order for most of the MATLAB files in the repository to run they require a accompanying excel datasheet from which to extract the data and perform the analysis. 

Example: 
```
if ispc
    Netload_365 = load_data('C:\Users\Sai\Dropbox\Sai - Research Work\Excel sheet Backup/Netload.xlsx','2015');
end
```
For the code to work download the excel sheets and add the path of the excel file you want to work on along with the sheet name to the **load_data** function at the beginning of the code.

Most of the code is self-explanatory and appropriately commented. Anyone who wants to continue the work on the project or analyse the work done should be able to get it up and running fairly quick. If you find something where a little more explanation is required, please let me know. 

The two functions **load_data** and **saveTightFigure** are must have for all other m files to run. Download these two before attempting to run any of the remaining m files.

#load_data.m

The function **load_data** reads the specified worksheet in the Microsoft® Excel® spreadsheet workbook and returns the numeric data in a matrix.

#saveTightFigure

The function **saveTightFigure** takes a figure and removes most of the blank white space MATLAB adds to the figure while saving it in pdf/jpg form.
